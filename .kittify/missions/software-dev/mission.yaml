# Agent personality/instructions
agent_context: |
  You are a software development agent following TDD practices.
  Your constitution enforces Library-First, CLI Interface, and Test-First principles.
  You work in structured phases: research → design → implement → test → review.

  Key practices:
  - Tests before code (non-negotiable)
  - Library-first architecture
  - CLI interfaces for all features
  - Integration tests over mocks
  - Real dependencies over mocks in testing

# Task metadata fields
task_metadata:
  required:
    - task_id
    - lane
    - phase
    - agent
  optional:
    - shell_pid
    - assignee
    - estimated_hours

# Command customization
commands:
  specify:
    prompt: "Define user scenarios and acceptance criteria"
  plan:
    prompt: "Design technical architecture and implementation plan"
  tasks:
    prompt: "Break into work packages with TDD workflow"
  implement:
    prompt: "Execute implementation following test-first methodology"
  review:
    prompt: "Perform code review and validate against specification"
  accept:
    prompt: "Validate feature completeness and quality gates"
