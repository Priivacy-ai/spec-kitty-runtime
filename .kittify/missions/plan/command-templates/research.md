# Research & Analysis

## Context

You are conducting technical research to support the planning process. Building on the feature specification from the previous step, you now investigate the technical requirements, design patterns, dependencies, and potential risks.

**Input**: Feature specification from the specify step

**Output**: A research document that captures technical analysis, design patterns, identified dependencies, risks, and recommendations to inform the design phase

**What You're Doing**:
- Investigating technical feasibility and requirements
- Researching applicable design patterns and best practices
- Identifying external dependencies and libraries
- Analyzing potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Documenting alternatives considered

## Deliverables

The research analysis should include:
- **Technical Requirements Analysis** (what technical capabilities are needed?)
- **Design Patterns** (what existing patterns apply? what proven approaches exist?)
- **Technology Stack Research** (key technologies, libraries, frameworks needed)
- **Dependencies** (external systems, libraries, APIs, data sources required)
- **Integration Points** (where does this connect to existing systems?)
- **Risks & Mitigations** (what could go wrong? how do we mitigate?)
- **Performance Considerations** (scalability, load, response time expectations)
- **Recommendations** (preferred approach based on research findings)
- **Alternatives Considered** (what other approaches were evaluated and why rejected?)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze technical requirements**
   - What technical capabilities must this feature implement?
   - What are the performance requirements?
   - What data structures or models are needed?
   - What integrations are required?

2. **Research applicable design patterns**
   - What established design patterns apply to this feature?
   - What similar features exist in the codebase that can be referenced?
   - What industry best practices should guide the design?
   - What architectural patterns are appropriate?

3. **Identify technology stack**
   - What programming languages, frameworks, or libraries are candidates?
   - What data storage technologies are appropriate?
   - What messaging or communication patterns are needed?
   - Are there preferred technologies in the existing codebase?

4. **Document dependencies**
   - What external libraries or packages are needed?
   - What internal systems or modules must be integrated?
   - What APIs or services must be consumed?
   - What data sources are required?

5. **Evaluate integration points**
   - How will this feature connect to existing systems?
   - What data flows are required?
   - What authentication or authorization is needed?
   - What side effects or impacts on existing features?

6. **Analyze risks and mitigation strategies**
   - What could go wrong during implementation?
   - What performance risks exist?
   - What security or privacy concerns?
   - What dependencies could be problematic?
   - How can each risk be mitigated or avoided?

7. **Document recommendations**
   - Based on research, what is the recommended approach?
   - What technology choices are recommended?
   - What architectural patterns should be used?
   - What should be prioritized vs. deferred?
